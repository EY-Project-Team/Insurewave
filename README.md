# Insurewave

Insurewave is a project created by EY for insuring container and shipping vessels used by Maersk. A contract will be created by the broker for the shipping vessels that need to be insured and send to the insurance company for insurance.

 

Three kind of users will be there EY users , Brokers, Insurers
First EY users will enter all the shipping details of the client in the Assets/Vessels page (eg) container, Ship, engine, anchor, crane
Broker User will create a contract for the assets that need to be insured he will calculate the premium based on the cost of each Vessels. Then he will send the contact to insurer.
Insurer user will accept or reject the contract, if its accepted it will be sent to Broker, and then the Broker will send the contract back to EY User.
 

This is a blockchain and IOT based project, itâ€™s an 1.5 year project if we use these technologies it will take more time. Above is the stripped down requirement of the project.
